	custom_invoice_ref ("Invoice Reference", 2026-08-06) included in both the SELECT and the
	search condition - the delivery-reconciliation "Link Invoice" match picker searches/displays
	by this field, not the ERPNext docname (see match_delivery_report's own docstring for why).
	Guarded with has_field since this endpoint predates that field and is called from other,
	unrelated flows too (e.g. PaymentDialog) that shouldn't break if it's ever missing.

	include_paid (2026-08-06): that same Link Invoice picker also needs to find invoices that are
	already fully paid - a delivery can legitimately match one settled in-store, and confirming it
	just wouldn't post a further payment. Opt-in and defaulted off rather than dropping the
	outstanding_amount filter outright, since every other caller (PaymentDialog etc.) genuinely
	only wants unpaid ones and shouldn't silently start seeing paid invoices too.

	exclude_delivered (2026-08-06, user request): the same picker shouldn't keep offering an
	invoice that's already been fully delivered - re-matching it would be pointless at best,
	confusing at worst. Deliberately keyed off custom_delivery_status == "Delivered", not "has any
	matched Delivery Report at all" - confirm_delivery_match's own design allows one invoice to
	have more than one Delivery Report (a Partial delivery now, the remainder later), and that
	invoice's custom_delivery_status only flips to "Delivered" once a Full delivery is actually
	confirmed against it. An invoice sitting at "Partially Delivered" (or with no delivery status
	yet) still needs to stay visible for exactly that follow-up. Delivery status and payment status
	are independent axes throughout this app (see confirm_delivery_match's own docstring) - this
	filter has nothing to do with include_paid above; an invoice can be excluded here regardless of
	whether it's been paid, and included regardless of whether it hasn't. Opt-in for the same
	reason as include_paid - unrelated callers have no concept of "delivered" at all.
